            Grogu (also known as "Baby Yoda" among fans and the media) is a character from the Star Wars
            Disney+ original television series The Mandalorian. He is a toddler member of the same unnamed
            alien species as the Star Wars characters Yoda and Yaddle, with whom he shares a strong ability
            in the Force. In the series, the protagonist known as "the Mandalorian" is hired to track down and
            capture Grogu for a remnant of the fallen Galactic Empire, but instead, he becomes his adoptive
            father and protects him from the Imperials. The character's real name was not revealed until "Chapter 13:
            The Jedi" (released on November 27, 2020), which also explained that Grogu was raised at the Jedi
            Temple on Coruscant during the Clone Wars. Prior to this, the character's official name, as used in
            subtitles
            and captions, was "The Child".
